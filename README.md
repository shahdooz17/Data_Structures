## Overview

The DSA repository provides a collection of code implementations, examples, and explanatory materials for a wide range of data structures and algorithms. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, this repository aims to help you strengthen your understanding of DSA.

## Installation

To use the code and materials in this repository, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
git clone https://github.com/shahdooz17/Data_Structures
2. Ensure you have the required programming language or environment installed (e.g., Java, Python, C++).

3. Explore the repository's contents and select the specific data structure or algorithm you want to work with.

## Usage

The repository is organized into separate directories for each data structure and algorithm. Each directory contains the necessary code files and documentation for that particular topic. To use a specific data structure or algorithm:

1. Navigate to the corresponding directory.

2. Review the documentation and code files related to the topic.

3. Use the code as a reference, modify it, or incorporate it into your own projects.

## Data Structures

The repository covers a variety of data structures, including:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
